        <h3>thank you Travis!</h3>
        <p>This app wouldn't be installed on your phone if the <b ng-click="goTo('http://www.travis-ci.com/')">Travis CI</b> team didn't provide their awesome API. It's well documented, fast and pretty clear.</p>

        <h3>disclaimer</h3>
        <p>This is not an official Travis CI application. It's a personal project that I made in my free time. Travis CI, the logo and the mascot belong to Travis.</p>
